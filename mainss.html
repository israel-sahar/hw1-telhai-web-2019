<h1>Portrait of a Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling</h1>

Portrait of a Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling is an oil-on-oak portrait completed in around 1526–1528 by German Renaissance painter Hans Holbein the Younger. The subject of this portrait is believed to be Anne Lovell, wife of Sir Francis Lovell (d. 1551), an Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII. 
The evidence for this was uncovered by stained-glass historian David J. King while studying the windows of the church in East Harling, Norfolk, the Lovell family's seat. King noted the Lovell family's coat of arms alongside squirrels in the stained glass, and also that the starlings in the painting are a pun on the name of the village.
The starling and the squirrel were traditional elements in the Lovell iconography.
Holbein painted the portrait during his first visit to England, which lasted from summer 1526 to summer 1528. 
King suggests it might have been done in winter, since the sitter wears a warm fur hat.
 During this first stay, Holbein worked largely for the circle of Thomas More and his connections: his drawing of More's ward Margaret Giggs shows her wearing the same type of hat. Holbein also painted portraits of Sir Henry Guildford and Mary, Lady Guildford, with similar decorative foliage in the background.

At this stage of his career, Holbein often adapted such designs from pattern books; in his last decade he set his portrait subjects against plain backgrounds in a more iconic style. Art historian John Rowlands judges this painting "the most charming of the portraits from Holbein's first stay in England".
